# donat.io
An AWSRaiseUp project by [Abdul-Muiz Yusuff](https://github.com/sacrael) & [Josh Malek](https://github.com/joshmalek)


A gameified Donation platform designed to piggyback on top of current online shopping pages.  Our idea is that a buyer could donate a percent of their online purchase (e.g. Amazon) to the Nonprofit of the Day, which is selected by a priority algorithm.  Our solution uses Amazon Pay for the donation, and the user recieves experience and medals for their donation.  They can share their donations on Twitter, and compete with their friends on the Leaderboard.
